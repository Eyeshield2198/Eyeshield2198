- :clock10: After work and after night classes on some days, I like to spend my free time learning the Japanese language with Duolingo. <br>
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I am also extremely interested in trading and have been reading, learning, and practicing them on the forex and crypto market. 
<br>
I am currently working on the following: <br>
- [ ] Complete my honours thesis, developing a deep learning trading bot. <br>
- [ ] Complete a football bet python script that aims to calculate `Probabilities` against `Odds` of football matches to derive an `Expected Value` to guide bets. This was inspired by a self-directed project done by an officer from my workplace during the 2022 World Cup.

I am currently seeking full-time employment opportunities in the Data Analytics or Trading field starting from July 2023 when my current internship ends. </h2>
